    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1. I am working toward reaching my goals such as having the job I want, the home I want, and knowledge that I seek. Some of the things and people that have helped me are school, parents, and friends.

2. I am working toward these goals by staying on track, managing my time, and staying organized. I also try to do my best working towards my goals.

3. I consider time the most important, knowledge, and experience. I'm a person who needs more time than others to work on something sometimes because I like to understand the question or work as much as possible, not only for myself but for me to teach it to others.

4. Some short term goals I want to achieve are having good grades till the end of this quarter.

5. I want to be known for being a good friend and a person who anyone can feel comfortable being with. I want to be known for a person who anyone can ask for guidance or help on anything, whether it be a math problem or advice on life.</p>
